# GreatApes

MSc project with Rebecca Lomas-Milne & Tim Bray. 

Aim: 

Question:
1. Can we recover the same MHC diversity from data mining as was found using traditional molecular tools?


Method: 

Search for MHC I (and possibly MHC II) data in the Short Read Archives (SRA) of the great apes genome project. 
Raw data is no NCBI. 

Use these data to estimate diversity. Compare with results from HiSeq and MiSeq runs (Hans et al. 2015 and 2017).
