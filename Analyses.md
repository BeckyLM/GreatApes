# Analysis of Great Ape data

Aims: 

1. How many loci are there? 

2. diversity measures

3. Phylogenetic tree

4. Comparison with Gorilla papers (Hans et. al. 2015 for MHC II, and Hans et al. 2017 for MHC I). 

Remember to note down the version of any packages or online platforms that you use. And keep track of the references for your report. 
It's often easiest to write the sections as you go, because the details are easily forgotten once you move on to the next analysis.
