# Analysis of Great Ape data

Aims: 

1. How many loci are there? 

2. diversity measures

3. Phylogenetic tree

4. Comparison with Gorilla papers (Hans et. al. 2015 for MHC II, and Hans et al. 2017 for MHC I). 

Remember to note down the version of any packages or online platforms that you use. And keep track of the references for your report. 
It's often easiest to write the sections as you go, because the details are easily forgotten once you move on to the next analysis. 


## 1. How many loci are there? 



## 2. Diversity measures

This can be measured using the R package [ape](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ape/versions/5.1). There are other packages too. If you can't get something to work in the first package you try, google your question and see what other people suggest. 

Packages need to be installed in R, and can them be called up from the library on your computer: 
```
## in R

install.packages("package.name") # you only need to do this once. 

library(package.name)

```


## 3. Phylogenetic tree

Here's a [vignette](http://www.phytools.org/eqg/Exercise_3.2/) to get you started.
